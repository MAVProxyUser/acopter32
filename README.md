VRBRAIN autopilot system

VRBRAIN  autopilot system  is a versatile UAV system based around the VRBRAIN multipurpose board loaded with a 32 bit version of Arducopter  firmware and a  ground station based on Mission Planner software.The autopilot controls the multicopter during flight using internal gyroscopes, accelerometers, and other electronic components. Flight missions are created using Mission Planner on your ground station and loaded onto the autopilot. Once the copter is placed in autonomous mode, the autopilot receives location data from the GPS module and executes the mission script. For safety, a radio control (RC) receiver is connected to the APM to allow for manual control using an RC transmitter.



System Components

    1. VRBRAIN autopilot board loaded with the latest version of  Arducopter 32 firmware
    2. Mission Planner software – gives you an easy point-and-click setup/configuration, along with a full-featured ground control interface
    3. A suitable vehicle for your mission
    4. Other useful options: e.g. data radios, which allow two-way wireless telemetry and control between the vehicle and your computer.
